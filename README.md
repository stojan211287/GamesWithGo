## Repository of code, made while following the online tutorial "Games with Go"

If you're interested, the tutorial is [here](https://gameswithgo.org/).

To run code, navigate into a directory and run

    go run .

Currently, we have :

* A simple game of PONG (complete with scoring). The game lasts until one of the players scores 3 points. You play against the AI and it is unbeatable. Also, you play against a backdrop of turbulence-algorithm-generated simplex noise.
* A demonstration of how to compute and render 2d Simplex (Perlin) noise, with the possibility of chainging parameters interactively, using the keyboard.
